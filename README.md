The world of data engineering is ever-changing, with new tools and technologies emerging on a regular basis. Building an effective analytics platform can be a daunting task, especially if you’re not familiar with all the tools available. How do you turn scattered, complex data into a model that drives insights and decision-making?
In this course, Thalia Barrera teaches data professionals how to implement an end-to-end data engineering project using open tools from the modern data stack. She touches on best practices such as data modeling, testing, documentation and version control and shows you how to efficiently extract, load, and transform data into a unified, analytics-ready format. Thalia shows you how to confidently select and use tools through practical examples—taking you through the construction of a robust data pipeline for a fictional ecommerce company—and how to implement best practices in data engineering.

## Instructions
This repository has two branches: `main` holds the initial state of the project, and `finished` holds the final state. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
You will be working in the `main` branch throughout the course. At any time, you can checkout the `finished` branch to consult how the finished project looks like.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 installed. If not, you can download and install it from Python's official website.
